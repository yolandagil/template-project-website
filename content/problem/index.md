## Introduction

Welcome to the problem page of our data science project! In this section, we will define and elaborate on the problem statement that our project aims to address.

Utilize the **Requirement Document** as a point of reference when working on this section.

## Problem Questions

1. **Question 1**: Clearly state the first main question you want to address with your data analysis. Describe why this question is important and how its answer can contribute to the project's overall objectives.

2. **Question 2**: Present the second main question you aim to answer. Explain its relevance and potential impact on the project's outcomes or real-world applications.

3. **Question 3**: If applicable, include a third significant question that complements the previous ones. Detail any dependencies or connections between this question and the others.

## Scope and Limitations

Describe the scope of your data science project and any limitations that may impact the analysis and findings. Address any data constraints, time limitations, or other factors that may affect the completeness of your results.

## Conclusion

Summarize the main problem questions presented in this section and emphasize their role in guiding your data science project. Reiterate the importance of finding solutions to these questions through your data analysis.
