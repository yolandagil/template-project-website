We set out to answer the following questions, across four themes:

**Timeline**

- What years were users most engaged in the topic of male contraception?
- Are there users who engaged with the topic of male birth control over multiple years?

**Geography**

- Do users mention specific locations?
- What is the context around which users mention a location?

**Sentiment**

- What are the sentiments of the users when they write about male contraception?
- Has their sentiment shifted or remained the same over the years?

**Topic Modeling**

- What general topics can we identify in an unsupervised manner from the discussions on Reddit?
