Welcome to the Approach Page of our data science project! In this section, we will detail the methods, techniques, and strategies we plan to employ to address the defined problem and achieve our project's objectives. 

Utilize the **Requirement Document** as a point of reference when working on this section.



## Data Collection

Explain the process of data collection for your project. Detail the sources of the datasets you used, any data acquisition methods, and any considerations taken to ensure the data's quality and relevance.

## Data Preprocessing

Describe the steps taken to preprocess the raw data before analysis. This may include data cleaning, handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and any transformations applied to prepare the data for modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Discuss the EDA techniques employed to gain insights into the datasets. Explain how data visualization, summary statistics, and other exploratory techniques helped you understand the data's distribution, patterns, and potential relationships between variables.

## Model Development

To address our problem effectively, we'll develop and implement data models. This section will detail the algorithms, libraries, and frameworks we'll utilize for model development, as well as the rationale behind our choices.

## Model Evaluation

Discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of your models. Explain how you validated the models and any cross-validation techniques employed to ensure generalizability.

## Validation and Testing

It's essential to validate our models and analysis rigorously. Describe the procedures and methodologies we'll follow to ensure the reliability of our results.

## Interpretation of Results

Once we have our results, we'll need to interpret them in the context of the problem. This section will explain how we plan to extract meaningful insights from our analysis.

## Conclusion

Summarize the main approach and methods used to solve the problem questions. Emphasize the importance of these techniques in generating meaningful insights from the data.
