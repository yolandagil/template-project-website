**Data Exploration and Visualization** (Sanjana and Jae)

- Create histograms:
  - Submissions by subreddit
  - Submissions by year
  - Comments by year
  - Submissions by users
- Visualize geographic data:
  - Number of mentions per US state
  - Number of mentions per US state per 100,000 residents

**Sentiment Analysis** (Jae)

- Calculate the overall sentiment of each Reddit submission
- Depict words most occur in each negative and positive sentiment
- Visualize sentiment scores for all Reddit submissions to represent sentiment trend

**Topic Model of Comments** (Lei)
